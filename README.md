### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tyler. I like Elixir, functional programming, distributed systems, and soft-real time systems.

Here are some of the open source contributions I'm most proud of:

- [`Enum.slide/3`](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/11349) in Elixir 1.13
- [genserver_architecture](https://github.com/s3cur3/genserver_architecture), the code that accompanied my [ElixirConf 2021 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZFLPG7V7RM)
- [elixir-raknet](https://github.com/X-Plane/elixir-raknet), the core of [the Elixir-based massive multiplayer server I built for X-Plane](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2021/07/29/bootstraping-a-multiplayer-server-with-elixir-at-x-plane/)
- [ultimate-elixir-ci](https://github.com/felt/ultimate-elixir-ci), the distillation of a lot of experience running Elixir in GitHub Actions CI
- [Fix for a memory leak](https://github.com/duckduckgo/iOS/pull/833) in the Bloom filter used in DuckDuckGo's iOS app (proof that I know what a pointer is ðŸ˜‰)
- [Unbound](https://github.com/s3cur3/unbound-app), a Mac photo browser I took over at the start of the pandemic.
